# Attach data disk to the Azure Virtual Machine

Storing the web application on the OS disk might not be the best idea. Imagine that you need to setup a disk backup for your web app: if you are using the OS disk to store the web app, disk backup would include both application and the operating system. Such backups would consume a lot of storage space, and it will be hard to restore them. The best practice is to segregate the OS and the application, by using a separate data disks for your application and application data. This way you get a better control over the resources, allocated for your application, and for it's performance. 

In this task you will practice working with data disks for Azure Virtual Machines, and deploy a new version of the web application to a separate data disk. 

## How to complete tasks in this module 

Tasks in this module are relying on 2 PowerShell scripts: 

- `scripts/generate-artifacts.ps1` generates the task "artifacts" and uploads them to cloud storage. An "artifact" is evidence of a task completed by you. Each task will have its own script, which will gather the required artifacts. The script also adds a link to the generated artifact in the `artifacts.json` file in this repository â€” make sure to commit changes to this file after you run the script. 
- `scripts/validate-artifacts.ps1` validates the artifacts generated by the first script. It loads information about the task artifacts from the `artifacts.json` file.

Here is how to complete tasks in this module:

1. Clone task repository

2. Make sure you completed steps, described in the Prerequisites section

3. Complete the task, described in the Requirements section 

4. Run `scripts/generate-artifacts.ps1` to generate task artifacts. Script will update the file `artifacts.json` in this repo. 

5. Run `scripts/validate-artifacts.ps1` to test yourself. If tests are failing - follow the recomendation from the test script error message to fix or re-deploy your infrastructure. When you will be ready to test yourself again - **re-generate the artifacts** (step 4) and re-run tests again. 

6. When all tests will pass - commit your changes and submit the solution for a review. 

Pro tip: if you stuck with any of the implementation steps - run `scripts/generate-artifacts.ps1` and `scripts/validate-artifacts.ps1`. The validation script might give you a hint on what you should do.  

## Prerequisites

Before completing any task in the module, make sure that you followed all the steps described in the **Environment Setup** topic, in particular: 

1. Ensure you have an [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) account and subscription.

2. Create a resource group called *"mate-resources"* in the Azure subscription.

3. In the *"mate-resources"* resource group, create a storage account (any name) and a *"task-artifacts"* container.

4. Install [PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4) on your computer. All tasks in this module use Powershell 7. To run it in the terminal, execute the following command: 
    ```
    pwsh
    ```

5. Install [Azure module for PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell?view=azps-11.3.0): 
    ```
    Install-Module -Name Az -Repository PSGallery -Force
    ```
If you are a Windows user, before running this command, please also run the following: 
    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

6. Log in to your Azure account using PowerShell:
    ```
    Connect-AzAccount -TenantId <your Microsoft Entra ID tenant id>
    ```

## Requirements

In this task, you need to perform the following steps: 

1. Create and attach a data disk:

    1. Use the infrastructure, you created in the [previous task](https://github.com/mate-academy/azure_task_2_create_a_vm). In the `mate-azure-task-2`, create a new mannaged disk, which meet the following requirements: 

        - size: 64 GB 
        - type: Premium SSD 
        - replication type: LRS
        - No infrastructure redundancy 

    2. Attach the data disk to the virtual machine you created in the [previous task](https://github.com/mate-academy/azure_task_2_create_a_vm). When attaching the data disk, make sure that you **set LUN to 42**.

    3. Follow the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/attach-disk-portal?tabs=ubuntu#connect-to-the-linux-vm-to-mount-the-new-disk) to create the file system and mount the disk to the virtual machine. Mount disk to the folder `/data`.

2. Deploy the **new version**  of the web application to the virtual machine
    
    1. Connect to the VM using SSH, create a folder `/data/app`, and configure your user as an owned of the folder: 
        ```
            ssh <your-vm-username>@<your-public-ip-DNS-name>
            sudo mkdir /data/app 
            sudo chown <your-vm-username>:<your-vm-username> /data/app
        ```

    2. Form your computer, copy the content of the folder `app` to your virtual machine (run the command in the folder of this repository): 
        
        ```
            scp -r app/* <your-vm-username>@<your-public-ip-DNS-name>:/data/app
        ```

    3. Connect to the virtual machine again using SSH, install pre-requirements, and configure a service for the application
        
        ```
            sudo apt install python3-pip
            cd /data/app
            sudo mv todoapp.service /etc/systemd/system/
            sudo systemctl daemon-reload
            sudo systemctl restart todoapp
        ```
    
    4. Verify that web app service is running, for that, run the following command on the VM: 
        
        ```
            systemctl status todoapp
        ```

3. Verify that web application is running, for that, open in a web browser the following URL: `http://<your-public-ip-DNS-name>:8080`. You should see the main page of the todo app. 

4. Run artifacts generation script `scripts/generate-artifacts.ps1`

5. Test yourself using the script `scripts/validate-artifacts.ps1`

6. Sumbit the solution for a review

7. When solution is validated, stop the virtual machine.
